# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
In this analysis, I've been taksed to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine Program. In this project, the Digital Video Games dataset will be analyzed from the Amazon Review Dataset. PySpark was used to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, PySpark was used to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
